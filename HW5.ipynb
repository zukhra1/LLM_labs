To find the number of jars they can make, divide the total number of strawberries by 7:\n\n70 (total strawberries) ÷ 7 = 10\n\nStep 5: Find the total amount of money they can make.\n\nThey sell each jar of jam for $4. Since they made 10 jars of jam, they can make:\n\n10 (jars) × $4 (per jar) = $40\n\nANSWER: 40<|eot_id|>\n\nTrue answer: 40\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"The attention mask and the pad token id were not set.

He knows from experience that 80 pages is one inch thick. If he has 6 books, how many pages is each one on average?\nGenerated Text: Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: Convert the thickness of the stack of books from inches to pages.\n\nWe know that 80 pages is equal to 1 inch, so to find the number of pages in the stack, we can multiply the thickness of the stack (12 inches) by 80 pages/inch:\n\n12 inches × 80 pages/inch = 960 pages\n\nStep 2: Divide the total number of pages by the number of books to find the average number of pages per book.\n\nWe have 6 books, so we can divide the total number of pages (960) by 6:\n\n960 pages ÷ 6 books = 160 pages/book\n\nStep 3: Simplify the result to get the average number of pages per book.\n\nThe result is 160 pages/book, which is the average number of pages per book.\n\nANSWER: 160<|eot_id|>\n\nTrue answer: 160\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"The attention mask and the pad token id were not set.

He uses half the pieces before finishing and is told to put the rest away.  He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.  How many Legos are in the box at the end?\nGenerated Text: Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: James starts with 500 Legos.\n\nStep 2: He uses half of the pieces to build the castle. To find half of 500, we can divide 500 by 2:\n\n500 ÷ 2 = 250\n\nSo, James uses 250 pieces to build the castle.\n\nStep 3: James puts the remaining pieces back in the box, except for the 5 missing pieces. To find the number of remaining pieces, we subtract the 250 pieces used from the original 500:\n\n500 - 250 = 250\n\nSo, James puts 250 pieces back in the box.\n\nStep 4: However, 5 pieces are missing, so we subtract these from the total number of remaining pieces:\n\n250 - 5 = 245\n\nTherefore, there are 245 Legos in the box at the end.\n\nANSWER: 245<|eot_id|>\n\nTrue answer: 245\nProblem: Ines had $20 in her purse. She bought 3 pounds of peaches, which are $2 per pound at the local farmers’ market. How much did she have left?\nGenerated Text: Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the cost of the peaches\nInes bought 3 pounds of peaches, and each pound costs $2. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of pounds by the cost per pound:\n\n3 pounds × $2 per pound =?\n\nStep 2: Perform the multiplication\n3 × 2 = 6\n\nSo, the cost of the peaches is $6.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the cost from Ines' initial amount\nInes had $20 initially, and she spent $6 on peaches. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the cost from her initial amount:\n\n$20 - $6 =?\n\nStep 4: Perform the subtraction\n20 - 6 = 14\n\nSo, Ines has $14 left.\n\nANSWER: 14<|eot_id|>\n\nTrue answer: 14\nCorrect answer: 5/5\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Analysis\n\n**Accuracy**\n\nThe accuracy of the model is still 100%\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nFor all problem, the model gives a clear reasoning path.
